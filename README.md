OSINT Integration: Integrating with Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tools to enrich Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) detected in the alerts.

TheHive Integration: Integrating with TheHive, an open-source incident response platform, to manage and track security incidents, create cases, and collaborate on incident response activities.

Case Management and Email Notification: Converting alerts generated by Wazuh and enriched with OSINT data into cases within TheHive and setting up email notifications to Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts for further investigation and response.

Objective:
This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for cybersecurity professionals interested in enhancing their skills in security operations, incident detection, and response using Wazuh as a SIEM solution.
